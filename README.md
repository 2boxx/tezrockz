##Tezrockz
Tezrockz is a chill game about collecting NFT rockz and stacking them, on the tezos blockchain.

##A foreword about NFT Games

Most NFT games have play-to-earn models incentivizing wild specualation with doubtful promises of infinite earning.
What we propose is a simple NFT game, with utility and no wild speculative promises.



##Structure:
-The game client was made with unity and compiled to WebGL.
-The cards are minted on objkt.com on our own collection.
-The game client is hosted on a website built using bootstrap and vercel. A domain from tezos domains was also hooked up ( https://github.com/martinsegura/Tez-Rockz-Page -- https://tezrockz.tez.page/ )
-The unity client gets the user-provided wallet address using the tzkt API and loads the rockz they have. (this should be change to a real "sync wallet" button later on).

##Gameplay
-The user can play with his rockz, stacking them. (More mini-games could be added later, giving more utility to the same rockz).
-The user can win the mini-game by stacking all the rockz he owns in a pile. (The more you have, the higher you can get. The higher you get, the more you can brag about it. But you need more rockz.)
-The game effectively is longer and harder for those who have more rockz, but this gives them more 'bragging rights'.
-The user can take a screenshot to share his achievement with his friends.
-There's a freeze power which is activated every certain meters. The user can freeze a rock with right click

##Future plans:
-Sync wallet
-Rockz museum (show your rockz)
-Adding more mini-games that provide more utility for your rockz.
